        ## TODO: Define all the layers of this CNN, the only requirements are:
        ## 1. This network takes in a square (same width and height), 3-colour image as input
        ## 2. It ends with a linear layer that represents the keypoints
        ## it's suggested that you make this last layer output 136 values, 2 for each of the 68 keypoint (x, y) pairs
        
        # As an example, you've been given a convolutional layer, which you may (but don't have to) change:
        # 1 input image channel (grayscale), 32 output channels/feature maps, 5x5 square convolution kernel

        x = self.maxPool(F.relu(self.conv2_bn(self.conv2(x)))) # 108 x 108 / 2 = 54 x 54
        x = self.maxPool(F.relu(self.conv3_bn(self.conv3(x)))) # 52  x 52  / 2 = 26 x 26
